<h1>Top Disney Movies according to Giorgia</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animation movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
    <h3>The Lion King</h3>
    <p>I love the values taught on this amazing moving, which are loyalty, friendship and courage.</p>

    <h3>Elemental</h3>
    <p>I love this movie because it shows to the children how diversity can be something to embrace.</p>

    <h3>Coco</h3>
    <p>This movie looks amazing to me because it shows that nobody has always the answer to the fatidic question 'what do you wanna be when you grow up?' and this is totally fine. highly recommended! </p>
